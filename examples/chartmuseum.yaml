# Example config file to sync a well-known chart repo to a local chartmuseum

# We are not syncing all charts, for simplicity
charts:
- etcd

# The bitnami chart repo is a well-known chart repository that we can use
# as source.

target:
  # The bitnami charts use docker as default container registry. Let's switch
  # to one of their mirrors to ensure the container references reallocation works.
  #
  # NOTE: This does not reallocate container artifacts, actually, but their
  #       references in the chart.
